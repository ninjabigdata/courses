	Reactive can improve computing efficiency
	Immutable nature of Reactive apps can help with app quality
	
	Reactive Systems are
		Responsive
			System responses in a timely-manner
			Responsiveness also means problems may be detected quickly and dealth with efficiency
			Provide rapid and consistent response times
			Consistency behavior simplifies error handling, builds end-users confidence and encourages further interactions
			
		Resilient
			System stays responsive in the face of failure
			Achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegtion
			Failures are contained within each component
			Parts of the system can fail, without compromising system as a whole
			Recovery of each component is delegated to another
			HA is ensured by replication where necessary
			
		Message Driven
			Reactive system rely on async message passing to establish boundary between components
			This ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency
			Msg passing enables load mgmt, elasticity and flow control
			Location transparency msging makes mgmt of failures possible
			Non-blocking communication allows recipients to only consume resources while active, leading to less system overhead
			
		Elastic
			System stays responsive under varying loading
			Reactive systems can react to changes in the input rate by +- resources allocated to service  inputs
			Elasticity is achieved in a cost effiective way on commodity HW and SW platforms
		
	
Reactive Prgmimg
	Implementation technique
	Focuses on non-blocking, async exec - key characteristic
	One of the tools in building Reactive systems
	Reactive Manifesto has wholistic view of the system where Reactive prgm is more granular at program level
	
	Async prgming paradigm focused on streams of data
	
	Common use-cases
		Ext service calls
		Highly concurrent msg consumers
		Spreadsheets
		Abstraction over Async process
		Abstract whether or not your prgm is sync or async
		
	Features
		Data streams
		Async
		non-blocking
		backpressure
		failures as messages
		
	
Reactive Streams API
	Goal is to create std for async stream processing with non-blocking back-pressure
	A set of 4 interfaces which defines the API
		Publisher
			Publishes an event
		Subscriber
			Subscribes to the event
		Subscription
			Subscribing to event
		Processor
			Process the event
			
	Spring Reactive Types
		Mono
			A publisher with 0/1 elements in data stream
			
			Operations:
				Block
					Blocks until response is recived
					
				Subscribe
					Subscribes to a consumer of this Mono
					
				Map
					Transform the item emiited by the Mono. This must sequenced with subscribe to execute the map function
		
		Flux
			A publisher with 0/many elements in data stream
			
			Operations:
				BlockFirst
					Blocks until first object is received from Flux
				
				Subscribe
					Subscribes to a consumer of this Flux
					
				
				Flux to Mono List
					Converts the Flux to list of Mono
					Then use MOno operations to consume the response
				
				Filter
					To filter the response based on Predicate and returns the Mono
					Returns empty Mono, if no match
					
				Filter with Exception
					Use single
					
					To log the error, use doOnError
					
					To perform some operation on error, use onErrorReturn
					
		Testing the Mono / Flux Objects
			StepVerifier
