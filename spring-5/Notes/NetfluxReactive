Netflux Reactive Example
	Stream Events using Flux generate
	

Functional Programming
	Imperative Programming - Programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state
	
	Funtional Programming - Programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
	
	Imperative										Declarative
	How to do it									What to do
	Mutable											Immutable (transforms)
	Has side effects								No side effects
	Pass objects									Can also pass functions
	Hard to compose									Functional composition
	Not threadsafe									Threadsafe
	
	
	RestTemplate									WebClient
	Blocking										Async and non-blocking
	Based on Java Servlet API						Based on Spring reactive framework
	Used one thread per request						Requests are queued and processed when available
													Uses Mono and Flux type
														Allows for functional / declarative programming
	
	

Spring WebFlux
	For non-blocking, reactive web-services
	
	WebFluxTest
		To test the controllers in WebFlux
		
		Add the annotation
			@WebFluxTest(<controllerClassName>.class)
		Autowire
			WebTestClient

Reactive MongoDB
	MongoDB
		NoSQL DB
		Stores 'Documents' in JSON like format
			Allows for complex objects
		Can optionally use schema
		Reactive non-blocking drivers are available
		
	Spring Data MongoDB
		Provides data repository for MongoDB documents
			Similar functionality as in Spring Data JPA
			Allows reactive type repositories (optional)
				This requires reactive driver
		Spring Boot auto-configures a local MongoDB instance on port 27017
	

Reactive RabbitMQ
	An open source message broker
	Uses AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) by default
		Very fast and efficient
		Written in Erlang, supported by Pivotal
	Reactive RabbitMQ is reactive API for RabbitMQ
